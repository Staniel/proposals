#  Support tiered storage natively in Strimzi

## Current situation

Kafka introduced tiered storage feature since 3.6. The feature is in early stage and it’s nice to support tiered storage configuration natively via Strimzi.

## Motivation

Supporting tiered storage via Strimzi allow Strimzi users to enable tiered storage natively with Strimzi config. By allowing to config custom configuration for `RemoteStorageManager`, users are able to adopt tiered storage feature on Strimzi easily.

For simplicity, the proposal doesn't add support to customize `RemoteLogMetadataManager`. If tiered storage is enabled, the default implementation class `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager` in Kafka will be used.

This proposal focuses on tiered storage support with a custom plugin brought in by the user. Other proposals in the future might add some built-in support for selected storage implementations such as S3. It should also be noted that, it’s on the end-user to ensure that their tiered storage setup works with Strimzi; the operator itself is strictly responsible for pushing down the necessary config to the broker pods.

## Proposal

Add a `spec.kafka.tieredStorage` field in the `Kafka` CR, which would support configuration for all tiered storage related configuration.

The `tieredStorage` config contains configuration for some selected configuration of tiered storage feature. Most importantly, the configuration for `RemoteStorageManager` is needed.

```
kafka:
  tieredStorage:
    type: customRemoteStorageManager
    className:
    classPath:
    config:
    # A map with String keys and String values. Keys will be automatically prefixed with `rsm.config.`.

```

### RemoteStorageManager (RSM)

The RSM config only supports custom type. The config allows users to specify the RSM class information.

Because the `RemoteStorageManager` dependency is provided by Kafka plugin, the implementation could vary case by case. It’s important to allow user to pass in additional configuration values within the supplied prefix range. The custom configuration can be supplied via  `spec.kafka.config` with the predefined prefix.

### RemoteLogMetadataManager (RLMM)

For simplicity, the proposal doesn't add customization for RemoteLogMetadataManager. If tiered storage is enabled, the default implementation using `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager` will be used, and corresponding configuration will be appended. 

The Strimzi Cluster Operator will automatically configure any required configurations for the RLMM such as the basic thread pool configs required to create the internal Kafka client and talk to the brokers.

Any additional RLMM configuration options such as performance tuning or security config options can be put in `.spec.kafka.config` directly using the `rlmm.config.` prefix.

Example can be found below.

### Example configuration

The below config define a sample configuration for tiered storage setup, using a `custom` RSM type.
```
kafka:
  tieredStorage:
    type: customRemoteStorageManager
    className: com.example.kafka.tiered.storage.s3.S3RemoteStorageManager
    classPath: /opt/kafka/plugins/tiered-storage-s3/*
    config:
    # A map with String keys and String values. Keys will be automatically prefixed with `rsm.config.`.
      storage.bucket.name: my-bucket
  config:
    ...
    rlmm.config.remote.log.metadata.common.client.bootstrap.servers: broker-bootstrap.com:9091
    rlmm.config.remote.log.metadata.common.client.security.protocol: SSL
    rlmm.config.remote.log.metadata.topic.replication.factor: 1
```

The configuration above will get translated to the below Kafka broker config:
```
# RLMM configuration generated by Strimzi
remote.log.storage.system.enable: true
remote.log.metadata.manager.impl.prefix: rlmm.config.
remote.log.metadata.manager.class.name: org.apache.kafka.server.log.remote.metadata.storage.TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager
#RSM configs set by the operator and by the user
remote.log.storage.manager.class.name: com.example.kafka.tiered.storage.s3.S3RemoteStorageManager
remote.log.storage.manager.class.path: /opt/kafka/plugins/tiered-storage-s3/*
remote.log.storage.manager.impl.prefix: rsm.config.
rsm.config.storage.bucket.name=my-bucket
# # Custom RLMM configs
rlmm.config.remote.log.metadata.common.client.bootstrap.servers: broker-bootstrap.com:9091
rlmm.config.remote.log.metadata.common.client.security.protocol: SSL
rlmm.config.remote.log.metadata.topic.replication.factor: 1
```

### Validation

There are certain [limitations](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Tiered+Storage+Early+Access+Release+Notes) for tiered storage enabled cluster.

We choose not to validate the error conditions at Strimzi operator layer because:

* At least some of them are expected to be removed in the future
* Validating them might be quite complex (for example, IIRC, the compacted topics can be set in the topic itself as well as in the broker defaults)
* Validating this in UTO would capture only a part of the topics and not prevent the users from misconfiguration. So they will still need to be aware of these rules and learn to respect them.

### Docker image

This proposal doesn't include built in plugin support in any Strimzi built Kafka image. Users need to specify the path via the config, and customize the docker image to include the library.

An example to build such custom image is via a custom Dockerfile:

```
FROM quay.io/strimzi/kafka:0.40.0-kafka-3.6.0
ARG REMOTE_PLUGIN_PATH
COPY ${REMOTE_PLUGIN_PATH} /opt/kafka/plugins/tiered-storage-s3/
```

## Testing strategy

Unit tests will be added to validate all the RLM,RSM, RLMM changes are propagated through.
Because the RSM and RLMM are typically provided by user and there is no built in support for any third party cloud provider, there won’t be any integration tests covering the cloud provider interaction. It’s the user’s responsibility to ensure the RSM and RLMM works with the intended cloud provider.

For testing purpose, an integration test with LocalTieredStorage implementation can be added to ensure end to end functionality.

## Affected Projects

Strimzi operator will be affected with the change.

## Compatibility

This proposal only add new configuration and API, so there is no backward compatibility issue for existing APIs.

## Alternate consideration

A simple way is to set everything via Helm chart config: https://github.com/strimzi/proposals/pull/98

That option is not favored because it's not applicable to usage without helm chart.
